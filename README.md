## 🌟 Overview

**Charge Master** is a self-contained, single-file web application designed to help drivers of both **electric vehicles (BEV)** and **internal combustion engine (ICE)** vehicles track every refueling or charging session. It requires no server, no account, and no internet connection after the first load. All data is stored locally in the browser via `localStorage`.

> 💡 Whether you want to monitor electricity costs per kWh or gasoline costs per liter, Charge Master provides detailed insights, seasonal breakdowns, and beautiful charts — all in one lightweight HTML file.

## ✨ Features

### 🚗 Vehicle Profile Management

- **🏎️ Multiple vehicle profiles** — register as many vehicles as needed, each with a custom name and preferred measurement unit.
- **➕ Add a new vehicle** via the **"+ Add Vehicle"** button in the Vehicles tab header, or via the empty-state call-to-action when no vehicles exist yet.
- **✏️ Edit any vehicle** — tap the edit (pencil) icon on a vehicle card to update its name or switch its unit preference between kWh and Liters.
- **✅ Select the active vehicle** — tap the checkmark button on any vehicle card to make it the active profile. The active vehicle card is highlighted with a blue border accent. All refueling records, statistics, and charts shown throughout the app are scoped to the active vehicle.
- **🗑️ Delete a vehicle** — tap the trash icon on a vehicle card. An inline confirmation prompt appears, warning how many associated records will also be deleted. Deletion removes both the vehicle profile and all its linked records.
- **📊 Record count badge** — each vehicle card displays the number of refueling/charging records associated with it (e.g. `🔋 kWh · 12 records`).
- **📡 Empty state** — when no vehicles have been added yet, a full illustrated placeholder is shown with a "Add Vehicle" call-to-action button.
- **🔔 Toast notifications** — every vehicle action (add, update, select, delete) fires a non-intrusive toast notification.

#### Vehicle Profile Form

The vehicle form is presented as a bottom sheet modal with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Free-text name for the vehicle (max 60 characters). Required. |
| **Preferred Unit** | Toggle pill: **🔋 kWh** (electric) or **⛽ Liters** (combustion). Determines labels across records, statistics, and charts for this vehicle. |

- The form title changes dynamically between **"Add Vehicle"** and **"Edit Vehicle"** depending on context.
- If the name field is left blank and the user taps **Save Vehicle**, the field shakes with a validation animation and the save is blocked.
- On save, the modal closes, the vehicle list re-renders, and the Refueling tab updates to reflect the active vehicle.

#### Data Isolation per Vehicle

Every refueling/charging record is linked to a specific vehicle via a `vehicleId` field. When a vehicle is selected as active:

- The **Refueling tab** shows only records belonging to that vehicle.
- The **Summary ribbon** (total records, total spent, total Km) reflects only that vehicle's data.
- The **Statistics tab** computes all metrics (min/avg/max price, total distance, average consumption, etc.) using only that vehicle's records.
- The **Charts tab** renders all 12 charts using only that vehicle's records.

Switching the active vehicle instantly updates all tabs and charts.

#### Migration from Pre-Profile Versions

When loading a data file exported from Charge Master v1.0.0 (before vehicle profiles were introduced), the app automatically detects that no `vehicles` array is present and performs a one-time migration:

- A `"Default"` vehicle profile is created with `unit: 'kWh'`.
- All existing records are assigned to this default profile via `vehicleId`.
- No data is lost.

The same migration logic applies when importing a legacy JSON export file.

---

### 🗂️ Record Management

- **➕ Add refueling/charging records** via a floating action button (FAB) that is always accessible. If no vehicle is selected, the app redirects to the Vehicles tab with a warning toast.
- **✏️ Edit any existing record** by tapping on it in the list — the same form is reused for both creation and editing.
- **📋 Duplicate any existing record** via the **Duplicate Record** button available in the edit form. See [Duplicating a Record](#-duplicating-a-record) for full details.
- **🗑️ Delete individual records** with an inline two-step confirmation to prevent accidental deletion.
- **📄 Paginated record list** — records are displayed 20 per page, sorted by date (newest first). When two records share the same date, they are further sorted by their `createdAt` timestamp (newest first), ensuring stable and deterministic ordering. Pagination controls are shown at the bottom.
- **🏷️ Each record stores:**
  - 📅 Date of the refueling/charging session
  - 📏 Distance traveled since the last session (in Km)
  - 🔋 / ⛽ Energy or fuel quantity (kWh or Liters, per the active vehicle's unit)
  - 💶 Unit price (€ per kWh or € per Liter)
  - 💰 Total cost (auto-computed in real time)
  - 📊 Cost per Km (auto-computed in real time)
  - 📍 Location / station name (optional free-text field, max 100 characters)
  - 📝 Notes (optional free-text field, max 500 characters with live character counter)
- **⚙️ Auto-computed fields:** As the user types quantity and unit price, the **Total Cost** and **Cost per Km** are calculated and displayed live inside the form, before saving.
- **✅ Form validation:** All required fields (date, distance, quantity, price) are validated on submission. Errors are shown inline with a shake animation on invalid fields.

### 🎨 Visual Design & UX

- **🌙 Dark Mode** (default) with a deep navy/charcoal palette (`#0A0E1A` background).
- **☀️ Light Mode** with a clean slate-gray palette, togglable at any time from the header or the Settings panel.
- **🎨 Season-colored record cards:** Each record card displays a colored left-border accent based on the season of its date:
  - ❄️ **Winter** (Dec, Jan, Feb) → Blue (`#60A5FA`)
  - 🌱 **Spring** (Mar, Apr, May) → Green (`#4ADE80`)
  - ☀️ **Summer** (Jun, Jul, Aug) → Yellow-green (`#D8FA3F`)
  - 🍂 **Autumn** (Sep, Oct, Nov) → Amber (`#FB923C`)
- **Cost-per-Km badge:** Each record card shows a color-coded efficiency badge:
  - 🟢 Green (`badge-good`) — cost/Km is below or equal to average
  - 🟡 Yellow (`badge-mid`) — cost/Km is between average and 120% of average
  - 🔴 Red (`badge-bad`) — cost/Km exceeds 120% of average
- **📊 Inline stat chips on record cards:** Each record card displays three stat chips in a row:
  - 🚩 **Distance** — kilometers traveled for that session.
  - 🔋 / ⛽ **Quantity** — energy (kWh) or fuel (Liters) consumed.
  - 💹 **Efficiency** — Km per unit (Km/kWh or Km/L), computed as `distanceKm / quantity`.
- **💡 Summary ribbon:** A persistent banner at the top of the Refueling tab always shows the **total number of records**, **total money spent (€)**, and **total kilometers** for the active vehicle.
- **📊 Sample data banner:** When sample records are present (flagged with `_sample: true`), a dismissable info banner is shown at the top of the Refueling tab inviting the user to clear the sample data and start with real records.
- **📡 Empty state:** When no records exist for the active vehicle, an illustrated placeholder is shown. If no vehicle is selected at all, the empty state instead prompts the user to navigate to the Vehicles tab.
- **🔔 Toast notifications:** Non-intrusive, auto-dismissing toast messages (max 3 at once) appear after every user action (save, delete, export, import, vehicle changes), with ✓ / ✕ / ⚠ icons.
- **⚡ Ripple effect:** All interactive buttons and tappable elements feature a touch-responsive radial ripple animation for tactile feedback.
- **🃏 Card hover animations:** All cards lift slightly (`translateY(-2px)`) on hover with a shadow effect for depth.

### 📊 Statistics Tab

The Statistics tab provides an analytics view filtered by a user-selectable time period, scoped to the **active vehicle profile**.

#### 🔍 Filter Bar

The filter can be set to one of three modes using a **segmented control**:
- **📅 Month** — select a specific month and year from dropdowns.
- **📆 Year** — select an entire year.
- **🗓️ Custom Range** — select any arbitrary start and end date via date pickers.

A badge displays the number of records matching the current filter in real time.

#### 📈 Key Statistics Cards

The statistics content is organized in a structured layout:

- **3-column price grid** showing:
  - **▼ Min Price** — the lowest unit price recorded in the period.
  - **≈ Avg Price** — the average unit price.
  - **▲ Max Price** — the highest unit price.

These price values animate from zero to their final value using an **easeOutCubic** animation when the tab is opened or the filter changes.

#### ⛅ Seasonal Breakdown (collapsible)

An accordion-style section groups statistics by season. Each season card (Winter ❄️, Spring 🌱, Summer ☀️, Autumn 🍂) is individually collapsible and shows, if data exists for that season in the selected period:
- Minimum price
- Average price
- Maximum price

#### 📋 Additional Stats (2-column grid)

A secondary grid provides:
- 🛣️ **Total Distance** — sum of all Km covered.
- 🔋 / ⛽ **Total Energy / Fuel** — total kWh or Liters consumed.
- 💸 **Total Expense** — total euros spent.
- 💰 **Average Cost per Km** — average €/Km across the period.
- 📈 **Average Consumption** — kWh or L per 100 Km.
- 💹 **Efficiency** — average Km per unit (Km/kWh or Km/L).

### 📉 Charts Tab

Twelve interactive charts powered by **Chart.js 4.4.1**, all themed to match the active dark/light mode and scoped to the **active vehicle profile**. Charts update whenever the theme, filter, or active vehicle changes.

| # | Chart | Type | Description |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Distance Over Time** | Line | Km per session plotted over time, with a dashed **flat average** reference line. |
| 2 | **Unit Price Over Time** | Line | Price per unit plotted chronologically, with a dashed **5-point moving average** overlay. |
| 3 | **Cost per Km Over Time** | Line | Cost/Km per session plotted over time, with a dashed **flat average** reference line. |
| 4 | **Consumption Over Time** | Line | Energy or fuel consumption per session (kWh/100Km or L/100Km) plotted over time, with a dashed **flat average** reference line. Color: amber (`#FB923C`). |
| 5 | **Efficiency Over Time** | Line | Per-session efficiency (Km/kWh or Km/L) plotted over time, with a dashed **flat average** reference line. Color: purple (`#A855F7`). |
| 6 | **Monthly Total Expenditure** | Horizontal Bar | Total € spent per calendar month (uses all vehicle records, not the filter), with bars color-coded by season. |
| 7 | **Average Price by Season** | Grouped Horizontal Bar | Side-by-side Min / Avg / Max price bars for each of the four seasons (uses all vehicle records). |
| 8 | **Average Consumption by Season** | Grouped Horizontal Bar | Side-by-side Min / Avg / Max consumption (kWh/100Km or L/100Km) per season (uses all vehicle records). |
| 9 | **Average Efficiency by Season** | Grouped Horizontal Bar | Side-by-side Min / Avg / Max efficiency (Km/kWh or Km/L) per season (uses all vehicle records). |
| 10 | **Average Cost per Km by Season** | Grouped Horizontal Bar | Side-by-side Min / Avg / Max €/Km per season (uses all vehicle records). |
| 11 | **Spending by Season** | Doughnut | Share of total expenditure per season (%), with legend and tooltips showing exact amounts and percentages. |
| 12 | **Refueling Frequency by Month** | Doughnut | Number of sessions per calendar month across all vehicle records, with a gradient color scheme. |

All charts feature:

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 🚗 Setting Up Your First Vehicle

Before adding any refueling records, you need at least one vehicle profile. On first launch, the app opens on the **Vehicles tab** with an empty state.

1. Tap **+ Add Vehicle** (empty-state button or the `+` icon in the section header).
2. Enter a **Name** for the vehicle (e.g. "Tesla Model S", "Fiat Punto").
3. Select the **Preferred Unit**: 🔋 **kWh** for electric vehicles, ⛽ **Liters** for combustion vehicles.
4. Tap **Save Vehicle**. The vehicle is created and automatically set as the active profile.

### ✅ Switching the Active Vehicle

1. Open the **Vehicles tab** from the bottom tab bar.
2. Tap the **checkmark button** on any vehicle card.
3. A success toast confirms the selection. All tabs (Refueling, Statistics, Charts) immediately update to show data for the newly selected vehicle.

### ✏️ Editing a Vehicle

1. Open the **Vehicles tab**.
2. Tap the **pencil icon** on the vehicle card you want to edit.
3. Modify the name or preferred unit, then tap **Save Vehicle**.

### 🗑️ Deleting a Vehicle

1. Open the **Vehicles tab**.
2. Tap the **trash icon** on the vehicle card.
3. An inline confirmation prompt appears, indicating how many associated records will also be permanently deleted.
4. Tap **Delete** to confirm, or **Cancel** to abort.

> ⚠️ Deleting a vehicle removes all its linked refueling records. This action is irreversible.

### ➕ Adding a Record

1. Make sure the desired vehicle is set as active (see [Switching the Active Vehicle](#-switching-the-active-vehicle)).
2. Tap the **blue `+` floating button** (bottom-right corner). If no vehicle is active, the app redirects to the Vehicles tab with a warning.
3. A bottom sheet slides up with the entry form.
4. Fill in:
   - **Date** — the date of the refueling/charging session.
   - **Distance (Km)** — the kilometers traveled since the last session.
   - **Quantity** — energy (kWh) or fuel (Liters) consumed, based on the active vehicle's unit.
   - **Price per unit** — the price you paid per kWh or per Liter.
5. The **Total Cost** and **Cost per Km** fields update automatically as you type.
6. Optionally add a **Location** (e.g. station name) and **Notes**.
7. Tap **Save Record**. A toast confirms success and haptic feedback fires on mobile devices (`navigator.vibrate`).

### ✏️ Editing a Record

1. Tap anywhere on an existing record card.
2. The form opens pre-filled with the record's data.
3. Modify any field and tap **Save Record** to update.

### 📋 Duplicating a Record

The **Duplicate Record** feature allows quickly creating a new entry pre-filled from an existing one, without altering the original.

1. Tap an existing record card to open the edit form.
2. Tap the **Duplicate Record** button (visible only in edit mode).
3. The form transitions in place — without closing and reopening the modal — into a **new-record state**:
   - The modal title changes to **"Duplicate Record"**.
   - The record **`id`** field is cleared so that saving will create a brand-new entry.
   - **Date** is reset to today's date.
   - **Distance** and **Quantity** are cleared — the user must fill these in.
   - **Unit Price**, **Location**, and **Notes** are carried over from the original record (all editable).
   - A hidden `createdAt` field is set to the current timestamp so the new record is correctly timestamped.
4. Edit any fields as needed and tap **Save Record** to persist the new entry.
5. A `warning` toast ("Record duplicated — edit the fields and save") is shown immediately after the duplication is initiated.

> 💡 The duplicate workflow intentionally leaves Distance and Quantity empty to force the user to enter the values specific to the new session, while preserving contextual data (price, location, notes) that is likely to repeat.

### 🗑️ Deleting a Record

- **Single record:** Open the edit form → tap **Delete Record** → confirm in the inline confirmation prompt.
- **Via context menu:** Tap the **⋮** (three-dot) button on a record card → select **Delete** from the dropdown.
- **All records at once:** Open Settings → **Delete All Records** → confirm.

### 🔄 Switching Between Tabs

- Tap the **bottom tab bar** icons: Vehicles 🚗 | Refueling ⛽ | Statistics 📊 | Charts 📈.
- Or **swipe left/right** anywhere in the content area (horizontal swipe > 50px, vertical displacement < 60px).

---

## 🗄️ Data Model

### Vehicle Profile

Each vehicle profile is stored as a JSON object under the `chargemaster_v1_vehicles` localStorage key:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4-string",
  "name": "Tesla Model S",
  "unit": "kWh"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | UUID v4 — unique identifier for the vehicle. |
| `name` | string | Display name of the vehicle (max 60 characters). |
| `unit` | `"kWh"` \| `"L"` | Preferred measurement unit. Drives all labels, statistics, and chart axes for this vehicle. |

### Refueling Record

Each record is stored as a JSON object under the `chargemaster_v1_records` localStorage key:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4-string",
  "vehicleId": "uuid-v4-string",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "distanceKm": 320.0,
  "quantity": 55.20,
  "unitPrice": 0.2500,
  "totalCost": 13.80,
  "costPerKm": 0.0431,
  "location": "EnelX Anagnina",
  "notes": "Optional free-text notes",
  "createdAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}
```

The `vehicleId` field links each record to its vehicle profile. Records whose `vehicleId` does not match any existing vehicle are automatically reassigned to the first available vehicle on load (migration safeguard).

### localStorage Keys

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `chargemaster_v1_vehicles` | JSON array of vehicle profile objects. |
| `chargemaster_v1_records` | JSON array of refueling/charging record objects. |
| `chargemaster_v1_settings` | JSON object with `{ theme, schemaVersion }`. |

## 📡 PWA & Offline Support

Charge Master is a fully installable **Progressive Web App**:

- 📲 **Installable** — on mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Chrome/Edge), users can install it to the home screen or app launcher via the browser's "Add to Home Screen" / "Install" prompt.
- 🔌 **Offline-first** — two Service Worker registrations are active:
  - An **inline blob-based Service Worker** generated at runtime (`initPWA()`), which caches the app shell immediately on first load using a `chargemaster-v1` cache.
  - An **external Service Worker** (`/sw.js`) registered via a standard `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')` call on the `window load` event, for environments where a physical `sw.js` file is deployed alongside the app.
- 🎨 **Themed status bar** — on iOS (via `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`) and Android (via `theme-color` meta tag), the status bar matches the app's dark/light theme.
- 🖼️ **Dynamic icons** — app icons (192×192 and 512×512) are generated programmatically on a `<canvas>` with the branded blue-to-cyan gradient and a lightning bolt symbol.
- 📄 **Web App Manifest** — dynamically injected at runtime with name, short name, description, orientation, colors, and icons.

---

## ⚙️ Settings & Customization

Access Settings via the **⚙ gear icon** in the top-right header.

### 🌙 / ☀️ Display Mode

Toggle between **Dark Mode** (default) and **Light Mode**. The toggle is available both in the Settings sheet and via the moon/sun icon in the header. Theme changes are saved to `localStorage` and re-applied on every subsequent load.

---

## 💾 Data Management

### 📤 Export

- Go to **Settings → Export All Records (JSON)**.
- A `.json` file named `chargemaster_export_YYYY-MM-DD.json` is automatically downloaded.
- The export envelope includes metadata: `exportedAt`, `appVersion`, `vehicles` (array of vehicle profiles with record counts), and the full `records` array.

```json
{
  "exportedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "appVersion": "1.1.0",
  "vehicles": [
    { "vehicleId": "uuid", "vehicleName": "Tesla Model S", "unit": "kWh", "recordCount": 24 }
  ],
  "records": [ ... ]
}
```

### 📥 Import

- Go to **Settings → Import Records from File**.
- Select a `.json` file previously exported from Charge Master (or a raw array of valid record objects).
- A dialog asks how to handle the import:
  - **⚠ Overwrite All** — replaces all existing records and vehicles with the imported ones (irreversible).
  - **✓ Merge** — adds only records whose `id` is not already present in the local database (deduplication by UUID). Vehicle profiles present in the import file but not in the local database are also added.
- **Legacy file handling:** If the imported file does not contain a `vehicles` array (exported from v1.0.0), a `"Default"` vehicle profile is automatically created and all imported records are assigned to it.
- If the file is malformed or contains no valid records, an error toast is shown.

### 🗑️ Delete All Records

- Go to **Settings → Delete All Records**.
- An inline confirmation prompt appears. Confirm to permanently erase all refueling/charging records from `localStorage`. Vehicle profiles are not deleted by this action.

---

## 📉 Charts & Visualizations

All charts are rendered with **Chart.js 4.4.1**, scoped to the **active vehicle**, and re-rendered whenever the active filter, theme, or active vehicle changes.

### Line Charts (Charts 1–5)

Five line charts are rendered at the top of the Charts tab:

1. **Distance Over Time** (`chart-distance`) — Km per session over time.
2. **Unit Price Over Time** (`chart-price`) — price per unit over time.
3. **Cost per Km Over Time** (`chart-cpkm`) — cost/Km per session over time.
4. **Consumption Over Time** (`chart-consumption`) — energy or fuel consumption per session expressed as kWh/100Km or L/100Km, plotted chronologically. Color: amber (`#FB923C`).
5. **Efficiency Over Time** (`chart-efficiency`) — per-session vehicle efficiency expressed as Km/kWh or Km/L, plotted chronologically. Color: purple (`#A855F7`).

Each line chart includes:
- A **primary dataset** with gradient area fill and data-point dots.
- A **secondary reference line** (dashed), which is a rolling 5-point moving average for the Price chart (Chart 2), or a flat mean for all other line charts.
- Responsive layout with `maintainAspectRatio: false` inside a 220px-tall container.

#### 📊 Consumption Over Time (Chart 4)

- **Y-axis:** consumption rate in `kWh/100Km` (electric) or `L/100Km` (combustion), computed as `(quantity / distanceKm) × 100`.
- **Primary line color:** amber (`#FB923C`) with a matching gradient fill.
- **Reference line:** flat average of all session consumption values in the current filter period, rendered as a dashed amber-yellow line (`#F59E0B`).
- **Tooltip:** shows the value formatted as `X.XX kWh/100Km` or `X.XX L/100Km`.

#### 💹 Efficiency Over Time (Chart 5)

- **Y-axis:** efficiency in `Km/kWh` (electric) or `Km/L` (combustion), computed as `distanceKm / quantity`.
- **Primary line color:** purple (`#A855F7`) with a matching gradient fill.
- **Reference line:** flat average of all session efficiency values in the current filter period, rendered as a dashed amber-yellow line (`#F59E0B`).
- **Tooltip:** shows the value formatted as `X.XX Km/kWh` or `X.XX Km/L`.

### Bar Charts (Charts 6–10)

- **Chart 6 (Monthly Expenditure):** Horizontal bars, one per month-year combination, colored by the season of that month. Uses **all active vehicle records** regardless of the active filter.
- **Chart 7 (Seasonal Price):** Grouped horizontal bar chart showing Min / Avg / Max unit prices per season.
- **Chart 8 (Seasonal Consumption):** Grouped horizontal bar chart showing Min / Avg / Max consumption (kWh/100Km or L/100Km) per season.
- **Chart 9 (Seasonal Efficiency):** Grouped horizontal bar chart showing Min / Avg / Max efficiency (Km/kWh or Km/L) per season.
- **Chart 10 (Seasonal Cost per Km):** Grouped horizontal bar chart showing Min / Avg / Max €/Km per season.

### Doughnut Charts (Charts 11–12)

- **Chart 11 (Season Spending):** Cutout doughnut (65% inner radius) showing the percentage of total expenditure per season. Tooltips show absolute € amounts and percentages.
- **Chart 12 (Monthly Frequency):** Doughnut showing how many sessions occurred in each calendar month. Colors use an HSL gradient from cool blue to warm blue.

All charts are properly destroyed (`chart.destroy()`) before being re-created to prevent memory leaks and canvas conflicts.

## ♿ Accessibility

- All interactive elements include `aria-label` attributes for screen readers.
- Bottom tab bar buttons use `role="tab"` and `aria-selected` to communicate the active tab.
- Modal overlays use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.
- The toast container uses `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcements.
- Season accordion headers use `aria-expanded` to communicate open/closed state.
- Form inputs include explicit `<label>` associations and `aria-label` attributes.
- Vehicle action buttons (select, edit, delete) each carry descriptive `aria-label` and `title` attributes.
- Color is never the sole indicator of meaning (badges also differ in value context; seasons also have icon labels; active vehicle is indicated by both border color and button state).
